# Manual Verification Checklist

## Completion and Indentation

- [ ] Trigger a completion menu (for example, by editing a Lua file) and use `<Tab>` / `<S-Tab>` to cycle through items.
- [ ] Expand a LuaSnip snippet, then press `<Tab>` / `<S-Tab>` to jump forward and backward between fields.
- [ ] In insert mode with no completion menu open, press `<Tab>` to insert indentation that respects `softtabstop`, and `<S-Tab>` to unindent the current line.
